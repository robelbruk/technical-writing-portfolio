            <h2>Reflective Essay</h2>
            <p>
                Over the course of this semester in ENGL 009, I have experienced tremendous growth as a writer, a thinker, and a future professional. This course was instrumental in helping me realize that writing is more than an academic exercise—it is a reflection of thought itself. Through various assignments and reflective discussions, I have sharpened my awareness of how technical writing functions in the world and within my own life.

            <p>
                I believe my strengths as a writer lie in my ability to organize ideas logically and transition smoothly between paragraphs. Throughout the semester, I consistently worked to ensure that my writing flowed in a way that made sense to the reader, structuring information in clear, progressive steps. However, I also discovered areas that needed improvement. I often struggled with crafting strong hooks that immediately draw the reader’s attention. Additionally, I realized that I had a tendency to overwrite, sometimes going off on tangents and adding unnecessary details that diluted my core message. Recognizing these limitations was an important part of my growth this semester, and through practice and feedback, I made deliberate efforts to address them.

                My understanding of technical writing before this course was limited. I was familiar with technical documentation from my experiences as a Computer Science student—documenting code, writing procedures—but I had not grasped the broader definition of technical writing as a diverse field encompassing multiple forms of clear and intentional communication. Through the assignments in this course, I came to appreciate that technical writing involves delivering precise, accurate information tailored for specific audiences, whether they are customers, clients, engineers, or members of the general public.

                The first major project that deepened this awareness was the <strong>HBCU.edu Assignment</strong>. When I first encountered the assignment, my mind immediately went to California, a place that has always fascinated me. During a trip in 2023, I explored Berkeley, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, and that experience left a lasting impression. Curious about the presence of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in California—a state often associated with innovation and diversity—I conducted research and discovered that there was only one HBCU in California: Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science. I found it meaningful to highlight this lesser-known HBCU, shedding light on its rich history and its dedication to addressing healthcare disparities in underserved communities. This assignment strengthened my research skills and taught me the value of unearthing unique topics that are often overlooked.

                The second major project, the <strong>E-Newsletter Assignment</strong>, provided an opportunity for personal connection. I chose to write about Brianna Balfon, a Howard University student who plans to pursue a career in social work. Conducting the interview—and really, having a genuine conversation—with Brianna was eye-opening. I gained a deeper appreciation for the enormous responsibility that social workers shoulder. Often, they become the lifeline for individuals navigating life's most difficult circumstances. Writing the newsletter article required me to capture the essence of another person’s aspirations while maintaining clarity, accuracy, and audience engagement. It was a new form of technical writing for me, one that emphasized storytelling within a professional framework.
            </p>

            <p>
                The final major project, the <strong>Job Application Package</strong>, allowed me to tie my technical writing skills directly to my future career. I chose to apply for a Software/Backend Engineer Intern position, reflecting my passion for programming and system-building. Crafting my resume, cover letter, and related documents required me to be strategic: presenting my skills clearly, tailoring my experiences to the job description, and maintaining a formal yet genuine tone. This assignment reinforced how essential good writing is in making a strong first impression in professional contexts, especially in competitive fields like technology.
            </p>

            <p>
                Overall, this course helped me recognize that writing, much like any technical craft, requires constant reflection and refinement. It pushed me to embrace constructive feedback, rethink my strategies, and view growth not as a final destination but as a continuous journey. I leave this class with a greater sense of who I am as a writer: organized, thoughtful, still imperfect, but increasingly aware of how writing—and technical writing in particular—serves as a bridge between people, ideas, and communities.
