            <h2>Hi, my name is Robel Bruk!</h2>
            <p>I'm a Computer Science major who enjoys building cool things and helping others learn how to do so. I enjoy building systems that solve complex problems, teaching people about various topics, and occasionally reading and writing.</p>
            <p>I believe that as humans, we have a Physical <strong>(Body)</strong>, Spiritual <strong>(Spirit and Soul)</strong>, and Mental <strong>(Mind)</strong> component. I actively work on all three: staying active physically through exercise, nurturing my spiritual life through Prayer and the Church, and developing my mental faculties through reflection, study, and Prayer. I believe the mind cannot function as it should without the strength of the spirit, and I strive to live by that truth.</p>
